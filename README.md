# Bachelor's Thesis of Andrei Clinciu

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my Bachelor's thesis called "Efficient web server settings under Linux".

I've explored how to optimize PHP servers even by looking how Facebook's HPHP PHP to C++ converter worked.
I explored the Intel SDK for hardware energy consumption which was a mess.
There have been hunderds of tests carried out with different types of forum/blog software.
I've measured everything with Linux command line programs to save logs.
Due to the nature of the logs I had writtena program called *plotchart_things.tcl*.
It helped me import all different logs into a SQLite database and then I've plotted everything, All charts have been created with that program.
